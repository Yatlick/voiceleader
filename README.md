Voiceleader
===========
VoiceLeader is a work in progress.

Eventually, this little app should allow music theory teachers and students to input short SATB voiceleading exercises for evaluation.

Input
-----
The app currently supports a very rudimentary input system created with html/javascript.  The user can input up to 10 notes per voice part, but sharps and flats are not yet supported in the staff tool.  Users can also type pitch classes directly into the input fields for greater flexibility.

Voiceleading
------------
The app will eventually support a wide range of voiceleading error-checkers, but is currently only able to check for chord types, individual notes' placement within each chord (root, third, fifth, seventh), parallel 8ths, parallel 5ths, parallel unisons, and improperly resolved 7ths.
